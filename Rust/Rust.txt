rustup self uninstall

rustfmt main.rs - to format rush file(kinda like pretrier)

to run -
rustc main.rs
.\main.exe

TOML(Tom's Obvious,Minimal Language)

In rust packages of code is reffered to as 'crates'

cargo new hello_cargo
cargo build - (default build is debug build, thus it generates deep inside)
./target/debug/hello_cargo
we can use , cargo run , instead of above to run
cargo check - this command quickly checks your code to make sure it compiles but doesn't produce an executable
cargo build --release(only when ready to release in production)

The prelude is the list of things the Rust automatically includes in the program.
use std::io;

cargo doc --open

variables and mutability
constants (need to specify type, can be declared in global scope, can be set to fixed value only-not the result of some value)
shadowing - even though variables are mutable, but one can't change it's data type, shadowing allows it to do so

Data Type -
Rust is statically typed Language - we must add a type anotation
Scalar type -
signed can be negative also, unsigned can not be negative (signed numbers are stored using 2's complement)
{ -(2^n-1) to (2^n-1)-1 }
i8 range = -128 to 127
u8 range = 0 to 255
checked add, overflowing add - to check some overflowing condition
f32 and f64 (default) are floating type
Compound type -
Tuple, Array, vectors
